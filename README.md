# Hack-packs
It can be hard finding the tools that your looking for, with out that bullshit preloaded sofware, Pentesting tools, Rats, Ddos, Binders, crackers and more

Rat - remote admin tools 
Dark commet - windows, linux
My favorit rat by far you need to setup a No.ip account
and port forword a port

Oeen router by opening your browser and type the gateway ip to the router
if your wondering open network propreties and look for gateway ip

Example Netgear - 192.168.0.1
Example 2 192.168.1.1 is delink

Pro trick 
Username and password to login to router 
Admin
password
or 
blank for user name 
and blank for password

Chrome, or what ever you use, once you such the correct ip to your gateway you should
be prompht to a login page.
Then allow port forording under advance.
recommand the port that dark commet sets as default
allow tcp port and portforward example 80

For the no ip account set it up
the ip you use type it into the infomation bar for ip and port 

This RAT is clever at what it dose, make the trojen by clicking buttion that says
make server, Warning dont freak out if windows defnder says you have a WinTrojen
you do have one on the computer its just your rat, Disable windows defender, or setup
a vertal box, its recommand

DDOS - danil of service attack, this is some script kity shit
Windows tools to perform a Ddos
Commonly used that i enjoyed, well theres many out there but heres is a couple i have picked out if the group that worked for mr
low orbit cannon - has TCP and UPD choice, if you dont know what is TCP, its telcommcation protocal, its surce and relint to succfully make it, UPD, is unkommon protcal destion, Its a protocal that most of the time don't make its taget to succfully commplet, Recommand TCP.
HTTP method is use at your own risk, Http method is for websites most of the time default port is 80



fuck some people up with a HTTP FLOOD or Slow loris attack
Http flood, well the name it self gives it away, For websites a http server can be flooded with a HTTP flood,
Unlike a ddos were if you didn't know you flood packets to a device to dissconect the device from the internet, the HTTP flood floods the http traffic
that dose its commcation back and fourth to work properly, 

Common ports, Xbox users, defult port 3075
tcp / upd works either way, recommand tcp over upd,
But if you wanna be a dick flood the users with a tcp port 3075 and puch a large ammount of packets.

MITM - who could forget my favorite type of method of attack, Man in the middle attacks
MITM tools for windows are hard to come by, my favorite is Cain able,                         Sniffers, sessions hijacking, BSSID and wep injecter, Crackers 
Cain able has some recommond fixs to get it to run right
Cain able needs Wincap                                   Follow the next steps carefully its important
   For Cain able click your wifi and open network internet settings, or such in the windows bar, network adpter settings, look for Change adptive settings
   right click on you network, open propties, now click on Ip4 internet idv, open advance and click were it says DNS, than allow DNS suffic, Than click
   WINS than allow NetBIO over tcp/ip.

Intersepter -NG is pretty bad ass to, no fixs you need to do to work like it should

Windows MITM tools like that are hard to come by, so if you find some that work hit me up at Derek1ization@gmail.com

Better protection, Download Tor browser for K1 k2 K3 and run proxy http, sock4 or sock5, when done right your ip will come out funny ass hell
Mine is like example 209:111:111:11 no joke and i apprently live in africa in the ocan

Windows can run kail linux programs and belive it or not u can setup your windows to run a linux envarment,
Download cygwin.exe
set what ever folder cygwin is under that you set under the envirment prop, add cygwin by clicking browser and add cygwin, if done 
right you can type into cygwin cmd, and command phrompht will run, than type cygwin into cmd to change back to.

Recommand download all of the package on cygwin install mirror

As far as sudo commands go AKA admin rights, download the bin file of sudo command and add it to cygwin's bin folder.

Qustions on how to use feel free to use the help command or /? or type help 
to navgite threw current dir/ is LS and type cd folder. tip mkdir is to make a folder
pro tip use the tab key when typeing a long folder name and it will finish is for you 

Some folders say, You dont have permission to modifiy, Chmod 777 or chmod +x the folder

Be sides that the world is a big place on the internet, you dont have to know much to stay safe belive it or not, 
Dont click on links from strangers,
Dont talk to strangers, even if its a woman, 9 times out of 10 anyways its a girl trying to con you or a dude,
Seems strange to think about huh, Well think about it, a guy will talk to a random girl anytime of night, unlike woman, woman will only talk to people that
they can trust


            ( My story and how i became a hacker or better known as a Cyber attacker)
            As a young kid no i didn't study books, or be a really smart kid, No i didn't study java script one day and decided hey im good at this.
            No i didn't have all A in my grades etheir, At 14 i was motivated to start learning because i saw a grop of hackers hack Microsft and Playstion
            servers, i was currious how something is done like that, So like most of us we just dont tell the truth we had to learn somewere. i watched 
            youtube videos, did some studying up on it i hade my frist phone a samsung Galxy 4 rooted and played around with some of the tools out there you can downlaod to attack, For andriod it was the attack its self scripted to be on a ON AND OFF SWITCH, i became intrested how much you could do and i wanted to learn how it is done, like what makes it do what it dose to work, i spent 6 years of learning, 2 years of the 6 i study Malware and how the fundumental basics of a 
            virus works, I spent hours putting Malware of all sorts just to see if i can take it off, By for to this day the only malware that got me is called the CD drive bomb, i would have been fine but at the time my computer didn't have usb bootable method so i had to use a cd with windows ios to boot,
            still didn't work, I spent some time in network admin, then some trogens, i fell in love with how backdoors, and trojen horses worked. I study
            a bit in socail enginarng, wich is a methed by sending, myself of course a link of a phinshing attack, I worked with Facebook snapchat and more
       Than as i got more conforbale with it i learned to ue a emulator, CMD, TERMINAL, POWERSHELL. So getting the basic idea down with Cmd, i moved on to kail linux, there it opened up a hole new door of tools i could use. Now i am passing my tips on to some one starting out, i hope i saved you much time because there was some times depending on the subject matter, i was up for days trying to find the legit tool thats not preload with adware and shit.
       
       Andriod users, if you are able to root your phone, wich if u can check to make sure download Kingroot apk, Not from playstore from chrome,
       
      Andiod user if you are rooted here are some fucking bad ass tools that u can use to fuck with people
      My Fav, Its a MITM attack, also injection tool, redirect ip and replace image's on ip device, The sofware is
      called, Network spoofer, this only works if roorted so if you do get it, Also dont update it leave it as is, its a shame but when you update it the 
      sofware becomes spyware for some odd ression, its fine as is 
      
      Also a MITM tool
      Zanti, this is a little bit more cleaner looking interface tool that has the same attacks like the previous tool i listed,
      Zanti also has a version on playstore to help protect u.
      
      This is a fun on i did this on the schools wifi,
      Its called Netkill
      Netkill lets you see all the devices on your network, you can dissconect or lower banwith from said device, 
      Netkill has a jail colum for devices that will have no wifi till taken out,
      
      There some other andiod tools that are kinda alright, but nothing compaired to what i just listed,
      
      WIFI CRACKERS
      
      well this day and age im am glad to see people are locking there shit up, any more it used to be you would see a wifi locked but they had a guest
      method to use for the wifi if need be, Well on a guest wifi its connected to the main wifi, this guest wifi works kinda like a DNS method 2
      well most likey i would log in and the gateway ip was given, so the default username and password, and yes there is a defualt username and password,
      Common ones Username:admin Password:password 
      if you really wantted to be a dick, use Command prompht to send a large ping request with max data limit
      cmd command use looks like ping 192.168.1.1 -t 8 -s 9000   -t this is how many times and s- well you know this is size
      A ping could be used just like a ddos attack but instead your sending a large ammount of data to see if the device is awake,
      See cmd netstat this should be flaged as a Icmp - icmp means may things but mainly its a Incompleted commcation multiplex protcal,
