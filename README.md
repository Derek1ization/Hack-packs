# Hack-packs
It can be hard finding the tools that your looking for, with out that bullshit preloaded sofware, Pentesting tools, Rats, Ddos, Binders, crackers and more

Rat - remote admin tools 
Dark commet - windows, linux
My favorit rat by far you need to setup a No.ip account
and port forword a port

Oeen router by opening your browser and type the gateway ip to the router
if your wondering open network propreties and look for gateway ip

Example Netgear - 192.168.0.1
Example 2 192.168.1.1 is delink

Pro trick 
Username and password to login to router 
Admin
password
or 
blank for user name 
and blank for password

Chrome, or what ever you use, once you such the correct ip to your gateway you should
be prompht to a login page.
Then allow port forording under advance.
recommand the port that dark commet sets as default
allow tcp port and portforward example 80

For the no ip account set it up
the ip you use type it into the infomation bar for ip and port 

This RAT is clever at what it dose, make the trojen by clicking buttion that says
make server, Warning dont freak out if windows defnder says you have a WinTrojen
you do have one on the computer its just your rat, Disable windows defender, or setup
a vertal box, its recommand
